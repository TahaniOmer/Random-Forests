# Random-Forests


We will use the Boston housing data to explore random forests. these data are in the “MASS” package’
It gives housing values and other statistics in each of 506 suburbs of Boston based on a 1970 census.
So, we will build lots of bushy trees, and then average them to reduce the variance
